        A set of selected data samples which were collected by LHCb\cite{LHCb} in 2011 are studied.
        Contained $B^{\pm}\rightarrow\pi^{\pm}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays in magnet ``up'' and ``down'' 
        polarity are constructed.Global $CP$ asymmetry in this channal is measured to be 
        $A_{CP}=0.135\pm0.023\pm0.010$,
        in which the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematical respectively.

        Standard Model\cite{SM} of particle physics, which developed in early 1970s, has been successfully
